In today's world, the reliance on the internet for information has significantly increased. Whether through voice or text search, search engines like Google need to process language and comprehend the context to provide accurate information. Machine learning models, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP), play a crucial role in understanding sequences and semantic connections to deliver relevant search results. Sentence embedding is one such technique used in NLP, where sentences are represented as vectors of real numbers. This helps machines understand the context, intention, and subtle nuances of the text.

Problem Definition:
Distinguishing between different meanings of words can be challenging for machines. Earlier models would often group similar instances together, missing the context. However, with advancements like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the environment of words is considered, resulting in more accurate language comprehension. BERT recognizes the context in which a word is used, making it a powerful tool for language understanding.

Limitations of Existing Systems:
Current systems in e-commerce websites often rely on keyword-specific approaches, lacking the ability to grasp the context of a conversation. They may provide inaccurate responses and struggle with sophisticated requests or ambiguous terms. Additionally, misspellings can lead to errors, and uniform responses to specific keywords make it challenging for users to find what they need.

Proposed System:
Semantic search systems offer improved accuracy compared to keyword-specific systems. By understanding the meaning of words and their relationships, semantic search engines deliver more precise results. These systems can interpret natural language queries and understand the context, resulting in efficient outputs. Semantic search is particularly valuable for complex topics where important connections between concepts may be missed by keyword-based search engines. By eliminating irrelevant results and focusing on the most relevant information, semantic search saves time and effort for users. Understanding the intent behind a query enables semantic search systems to provide quick and easy access to the desired information.
