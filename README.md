# SENTENCE-EMBEDDING-USING-SBERT
Our Q&amp;A retrieval system employs the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, based on SBERT, to generate query sentence vectors. These vectors are used to calculate similarity scores using cosine similarity, allowing us to select the most relevant answer. Our system ensures accurate results by leveraging semantic understanding.
